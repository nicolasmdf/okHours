  <h1>Hour Logger</h1>
<p>This is a very simple tool to log the amount of time that passes before a certain event occurs in your life.</p>
<p>The idea is to make this on android so I can put it on my phone and not loose count every time I close the window, but since js is all I know at the moment it will live here for a few days until I get some basic Java in my brain.</p>

<div id="hoursPassed"></div>
<button id="resetButton" onclick="time.reset()">Fuck up!</button>
  
    <script src="js/index.js"></script>

</body>
